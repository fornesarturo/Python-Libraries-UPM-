##Context <div id=”context”></div>
ITESM has grown as time passed. More students, new buildings, new zones, but there's an something that hasn't been growing hand in hand, the parking lot. An increase in the quantity of people occupying the campus means more cars will transit its parking lot, looking for spaces to park in. This saturation results in spending a long period of time looking for a spot in which to park.

##Problem Description <div id=”problem”></div>
Drivers wander the parking lot aimlessly, looking for a parking spot in a zone of the parking lot that, without them knowing, is already full. This period of time could be reduced, if only they knew where to go exactly.
